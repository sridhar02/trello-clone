# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS

  Note: As the assignment is for front-end only, registration and login should be done at the local level only (e.g., using local storage).
2. Dashboard Screen
The dashboard should display a list of projects in cards.
The cards should include the project title, description, and a cover image.
Implement pagination to limit the number of projects displayed on the dashboard.
3. Project Screen
When a user clicks on a project card, they should be redirected to the project screen.
The project screen should display the project title, description, and a list of tasks.
The tasks should be displayed as cards and should include the task title, description, and assigned user (if any).
4. Task Card Popup
On clicking a task card, a popup should appear showing task information such as task title, description, assigned user, and due date.
5. Drag and Drop Task Movement
Implement drag and drop functionality to move tasks between lists. The change in task position should be reflected in the application state.
6. Cypress Test Cases
Write test cases for the following functionality: Login and registration form validation
Task card popup
Drag and drop task movement
